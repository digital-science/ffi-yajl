## 1.3.0 (11/22/2014)

### New features

* [**Jason Potkanski**](https://github.com/electrawn):
  Cygwin detection

### Changes

* warn on fallback to ffi when yajl-ruby is loaded (ffi-yajl and yajl-ruby use incompatible yajl c-libs)
* warn when we don't use the c ext on MRI or RBX (ffi is currently much slower than the c-ext)
* further bumped the libyajl2-gem pin to ~> 1.2 (required for the cygwin users)
* fix minimum libyajl2-gem version to ~> 1.1 (ffi-yajl >= 1.2.0 with libyajl2-gem 1.0 fails on windows)
* allow the c-ext to load on ruby 1.8.7

### Bugs fixed

* fixes using Arrays and Hashes (and true/false/nil) as Hash keys
* fixes bare object parsing in issue #2 and #6
* fixes parsing nil object to not coredump the MRI ruby VM (issue #15)

## 1.2.0 (10/09/2014)

### Changes

* Encoding Object will no longer blindly call .to_json().  It will first check if the Object supports a .to_json() method
and if it does not it will call .to_s().  This prevents NoSuchMethod errors when not using the JSON gem.  

### Bugs fixed

* C extension was broken on windows due to libyajl.so being renamed to yajl.dll which has been reverted in
  libyajl2-gem.
* Change Config to RbConfig for FFI-based dlopen for non-DL/non-Fiddle fallback.

## 1.1.0 (08/26/2014)

### New features

* Support encoding Date, Time and DateTime objects

### Bugs fixed

* Fixed Rubinius on at least Ubuntu 14.04 and Mac
* [**Lennart Brinkmann**](https://github.com/lebrinkma):
  remove `-Wl,--no-undefined` if ruby mkmf.rb adds it in the CFLAGS because we do not directly link against `-lyajl`

## 1.0.2 (08/09/2014)

### Bugs fixed

* fixed opts chaining issue in the encoder that was breaking pretty printing in knife
* changed default :allow_comments to true (considered a regression against yajl-ruby compatibility)

## 1.0.1 (07/17/2014)

* No ChangeLog entries for this version or earlier, check the commit logs
